=======================

This is the repository the instructors will develop as the boot camp unfolds, as if we were the model student.

When we wear our instrutor hats, we put lesson material in our boot camp's main repository: https://github.com/jennybc/2014-05-12-ubc.

The main repository underpins our boot camp's web page: http://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc/.
